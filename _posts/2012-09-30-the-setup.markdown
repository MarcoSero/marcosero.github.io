I needed a script to quickly setup a development environment on my MacBook Pro.

I read about a GitHub tool called "[The Setup][1]", but unfortunately it is not yet open source. Because of that, after some research, I found a Thoughtbout project, [laptop][2], which has the same purpose, so I decided to fork it and create my own [Setup][3].

It automates a lot of boring tasks installing:

- GitHub SSH-keys
- Ruby through RVM
- rails gem
- heroku gem
- mysql2 gem
- pg gem
- mongodb gem
- foreman gem
- capistrano gem
- Homebrew
- MySQL
- Postgres
- MongoDB
- ack
- tmux
- ImageMagick
- QT
- Heroku plugins

In the future I would add the setup of Sublime Text 2 and .dotfiles.

You can find it on my GitHub: [The Setup][3]
