Last week I gave a talk at
[NSLondon](http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/events/224592143).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/marcosero">@marcosero</a> kicks off <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSLondon?src=hash">#NSLondon</a> with his talk on Legacy Apps <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAppBusiness">@TheAppBusiness</a> <a href="http://t.co/7eAfttcgjI">pic.twitter.com/7eAfttcgjI</a></p>&mdash; Shaps ï£¿ (@shaps) <a href="https://twitter.com/shaps/status/636965945118969856">August 27, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was actually the first time I did any kind of public speaking and the reason
is simple: I never felt I knew anything that most other people didn't already
know or that was worth sharing.  But then I realized that I worked at Yammer
for almost a year and I did something that most other iOS developers don't
usually do: working on a legacy app.  And so that was the topic for my talk.

I really enjoyed the experience and I'm happy that I got a very positive
feedback, both in person and on Twitter.

You can find the slides on [Speaker
Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/marcosero/working-on-a-legacy-app) and embedded
below. The talk was recorded, so I will update this post as soon as the video
is out.
