Every time I start to learn a new language, I have fun writing a [Cloud App][1] Roulette.  
It is a little script that generates Cloud App-like URLs checking if they are valid, to obtain a list of public images and files uploaded by anyone.

I coded my own Cloud App Roulette in Java first, then PHP, Javascript, C and Objective-C. Now I wrote it in Ruby as well, just to keep up :)

With these few lines I learned _a lot_ of useful things:

- different variables' scope, globals and privates
- map function
- read a status of a page
- multithreading, semaphores and synchronized blocks
