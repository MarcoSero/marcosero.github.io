The new version (> 6.0) of the Facebook app is probably one of the best non-Apple's app in the store nowadays.  
Every day, I look forward to the next update to see what they've added and to understand how they've done it.

In one of the latest updates, the hacker [@chpwn](https://twitter.com/chpwn) added this awesome feature:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="it"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/aaronash">aaronash</a> you should try the swipe back gesture I did for the latest Facebook update</p>&mdash; Grant Paul (chpwn) (@chpwn) <a href="https://twitter.com/chpwn/status/334061769364492289">13 maggio 2013</a></blockquote>

Basically a kind of hack of `UINavigationController` to slide to the previous view controller in the navigation stack.

And the response was quite good:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="it"><p>Dynamic swipe back behaviour in UINavigationControllers (like Flurry and the new Facebook app update) need to be a thing. They're awesome.</p>&mdash; Adam Bell (@b3ll) <a href="https://twitter.com/b3ll/status/334291351829110784">14 maggio 2013</a></blockquote>

So, why shouldn't I try to create something similar for my own apps?  

Taking advantage of few spare hours in a sunny Sunday of May, here you are:
