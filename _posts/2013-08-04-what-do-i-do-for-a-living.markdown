I decided to write this post because I don't know who I am. Well, from a professional point of view I don't know who I am.

I am always a bit afraid when I know people are gonna ask me the infamous question - "*What do you do for a living?*".  
At this point, my mind starts running my personal algorithm for answering questions, which takes two inputs: 

1. the question to be answered 
2. the person that needs the answer

Based on these two very inputs, I generally elaborate all my answers. But, just to explain what my job is, the second input is split in many other inputs which are:

2. is the person a friend, an acquaintance or a complete stranger
3. is the person tech savvy / knows what a programmable computer is
3. is the person interested in what the answer will be

Now, the algorithm gets a little bit trickier and the output (aka the answer) might take a while to be calculated (in the meantime I look like a bloody idiot blabbing something like "ehhh...eemmmhh...ehhhh") but eventually I've got the answer. Well, the answers:

- I ***program computers*** (if the person doesn't give a damn what I actually do for a living)
- I ***make iPhone and iPad apps*** (if the person is *not* tech savvy)
- I am an ***iOS [Software] Developer*** (if the person is tech savvy)
- I am an ***iOS [Software] Engineer*** (again, just if the person is tech savvy)

Those are my answers, because is what I rather say, at the moment. But I am not really sure if they are the best possible answers.  
At the beginning, I was torn to define myself an "Engineer", a "Developer" or just a "Programmer". But eventually I analysed each of them and took my decision.

Let's start from the latter. I don't quite like the term **programmer**. It feels empty to me. It feels like a cold machine which types stupid nonsense characters in front of  another machine. So, I prefer not to use this term.

I much rather use the term **developer** than programmer, not because I like it, just because it seems the most recognised term for a person who writes software. And it is much less worse than programmer.

But at the moment I quite like to use the term **engineer**. I don't actually have an engineering degree (nor I want one), so probably calling myself engineer is not right.  
Nevertheless, my job title is "Application Engineer", the department I work in is the "Engineering Department" and my colleagues are engineers.  
I fancy this term because it says much more about my actual work. I find myself spending less and less time coding and much more time discussing requirements, thinking about high level architectures, drawing diagrams to find the best ways to *engineer* the software.

There is another term which I really like it *a lot*: **Software Craftsman**. It is just two words but, it describes what I do during my 9-6 job and what I am passionate about: crafting software.
