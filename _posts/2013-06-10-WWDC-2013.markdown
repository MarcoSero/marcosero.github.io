As iOS developer, here's my humble list of what I hope to see today:

Fix **UICollectionView's**, or everyone will be using [PSTCollectionView](https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView) (which is great by the way).

Fix **iCloud**. Because *it just doesn't work*. A back-end as a service like Parse which worked natively with Core Data would be great.

Open **Siri** to third party developers to make it useful.

Last but not least, give me a damn **Macbook Air Retina**! It will not happen, I already know.
