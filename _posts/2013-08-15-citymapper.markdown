[Citimapper](http://citymapper.com/)'s release notes:

> 3.2: Bug fixes.  
Just kidding, we added a new city.  
New Yorkers, welcome to Citymapper!  
Londoners, be nice. Well according to Apple's localisation technology, if you're reading this, we assume you're in London. Or you have your language set to UK English (instead of Default English, whatever that is- how rude). Or you happen to be on the UK App Store. Honestly, we're not completely sure how this works, except that if you are not in London, then you're wrong, because according to Apple you are in London, and thats whats really important.  
So yes, we added a new city, with all its quirks and complexities. Which shouldn't matter to you since you're in London anyway. Unless you're not in which case you're wrong. Of course if you do happen to go to New York, our app will automatically figure that out and offer you a Subway ride (its like the Tube except somewhat cheaper but smellier and it runs 24 hours, although good luck trying to ride it after hours). Or if you happen to be somewhere else entirely, e.g. on a tropical island somewhere, the app will ask you which city you wish to use, but really why are you reading this, just go enjoy yourself.  
Btw, why did the American cross the road? To get to the gas station!  
Hahaha.  
Don't worry, no Americans can read this. This is our own secret place where we can say what we want. Because according to Apple's localisation technology, all of us are in London. Aside from the NSA, who are probably reading this. And trying to decipher our UK English.  
So anyway, what have you done for me lately you say.  
Bus stops and tube stations have been updated, we're now showing next scheduled departures for buses and lines that are not running live anytime soon. Why show first tube but not last tube you ask? That's a very good and observant question, and one we're asking ourselves as well.  
We've also updated various transport data especially bus stops across the city (thanks to everybody that reported!).  
London rest assured we're not done with you yet. There are still too many problems to solve. But its time to grow up and embrace the complexity. London is where the first underground transportation system was created, and probably where the first miserable commute was experienced. And now that this torture has been passed on to other cities, we must save all the citydwellers of the world! Alas, the simple days are gone, and we enter a more complicated and wondrous place. Citymapper is now global.

The app is gorgeous and they are brilliant.
