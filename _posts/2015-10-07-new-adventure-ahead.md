After just one year at Microsoft working on the Yammer iOS app, I'm ready for a new adventure.  

I'm super excited to announce that I have accepted a job at <img src="/images/google-logo.png" alt="Google" height="20" style="display:inline-block;margin:-5" />!!!  
Before you ask: yes I will stay in London and no I won't start writing Java anytime soon :)

I literally can't wait to join the team and build cool products used by millions of people (pretty scary, I know!).
