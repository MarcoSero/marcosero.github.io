I have finally managed to find some time to put my dotfiles under source control
and publish them on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcoSero/dotfiles).

I tweaked them a lot until I found a configuration that I liked, but they are 
not perfect of course and they often change as soon as I learn a new trick.  

I think there are some nice little gems in there ([this](https://github.com/MarcoSero/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L35-L46) is my favorite) so I hope you can find something useful.
